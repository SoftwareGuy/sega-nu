# sega-nu

I recently had my hand on an used Sega Nu for PDAFT (Project Diva Arcade Future Tone) with Keychip, as I restore the unit and trying to get the game to launch, I will try my best to document the hardware of the system and the process I used to restore the system. Most of the images were taken before the TPM sniffing attack to defeat bitlocker, I didn't do much cleaning and didn't want to take my chances in case an mistake caused the TPM to reset. 

Apologies for the dirty motherboard pictures.
